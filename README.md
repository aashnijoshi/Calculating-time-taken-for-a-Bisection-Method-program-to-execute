# Calculating time taken for a Bisection Method program to execute
This program calculates the time at the start of the program and at the end of it. It then subtracts both to return the time taken for the program to the run. The program taken is the program for calculating the root of a given function by Bisection method.

In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods
